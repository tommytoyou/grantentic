  "problem_statement": "Current ground-based asteroid detection systems have significant blind spots, limited sky coverage, and weather dependencies. NASA's 2005 Congressional mandate to detect 90% of near-Earth objects larger than 140m is still unmet. The 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor (20m diameter) went undetected, causing extensive damage. Space-based detection offers 24/7 coverage, no atmospheric interference, and earlier warning times critical for planetary defense.",
  
  "solution": "A constellation of 12-24 specialized CubeSats in strategic orbits providing continuous sky coverage. Each satellite uses advanced CMOS sensors, machine learning algorithms for automated detection, and constellation-wide data fusion to track asteroids weeks earlier than ground systems. The system costs 100x less than traditional space telescopes while providing superior coverage.",
